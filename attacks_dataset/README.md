### attacks_dataset folder 

This is the equivalent of root folder of the react dropbox. 

* Other folder experts certain content to be present here:
    - ./attacks is required (new format, rm the ./attacks/old from dropbox)
    - ./target_models is required 

The directory naming convention is important as they will be used to determine other things in experimetns, e.g. which target model from Transformers to use, etc.
